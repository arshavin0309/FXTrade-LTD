On an ascending or bullish trader, you can earn both on an increase in the price of a currency pair and on temporary rollbacks (corrections). They use manual closing, Stop Loss orders (fixing losses) and Take Profit (profits). The search for points of view is based on the same rules of technical analysis.</p>

                    <p>For a simple application of technical analysis of the trading period from the beginning of trading on Monday to its completion in a high degree at the level of gaps - time frames. Thanks to them, it is possible to analyze the most significant parameters. These include the price at the time of opening / closing the period, price minimum / maximum, volumes.</p>

                    <p>The trading platform offers several standard time frames - from M1 (minute) to MN (month). The chart is divided into nine time frames, in addition to the extreme ones, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, W1 are used. The dynamics of visual price changes depends on the choice of the period. Short-term trading systems use time intervals no older than M30. Sometimes traders resort to the formation of non-standard time frames. Their task is to compensate for the shortcomings of typical values. For example, if the indicator on H1 displays a late value, and on M30 it is “in a hurry”. Presumably "average value", i.e. M45 timeframe should show the most accurate time to open trades.</p>

                        <p>Periodic repetition of previously occurring events allows you to prepare for them and, in a timely manner, identifying a tendency to return to previous positions, earn profit. A trader has a lot of tools in his arsenal: support/resistance levels, ascending and descending channels. The terminal has built-in functions for drawing the necessary lines on the chart of a currency pair, access to them is provided from the "Graphic Tools" panel.</p>

                        <h3>In addition to the standard lines, tools are offered:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grid, fan, arcs, time zones, Fibonacci channel</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>The listed trading "add-ons" are an attempt to mathematically predict the subsequent price movement based on the technical analysis of the previous trend dynamics in the market. The use of channel instruments allows you to trade at the moments of price reversal within the channel, taking into account the current trend. Channel lines indicate where a correction is most likely to reverse, if the price moves against the trend, support/resistance lines show the price level where a trend change is likely, the beginning of a protracted correction. All technical analysis tools are based on mathematical calculations and are used mainly as a basis for determining trends, and more precisely, the moment of entering the market is determined by indicators.</p>

                        <p>Candlesticks also display the volatility of a currency pair. If you switch to periods from H4 and above, it will become clear in what range the price is moving in the current month or this week, is there a risk of a reversal, the market entering a long-term flat.</p>
