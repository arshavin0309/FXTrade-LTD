                <h2>What information should you follow?</h2>

                <details>
                    <summary>Money-credit policy</summary>
                    <p>Monetary policy maintained by central banks directly affects capital and money markets as it regulates the supply of money and thus directly affects its value.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Economic relations</summary>
                    <p>Economic relations have a major impact on how investors perceive local markets. If a country has a strong trading relationship, investors view the country as economically stable with the potential to increase profits.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Situation in other markets</summary>
                    <p>The situation in other markets is important when considering an investment decision as to where and when funds should be transferred between countries. When capital markets in one country move in the opposite direction of the trend, investors start to suffer losses, capital will move out of the country, and may also cause the local currency to depreciate.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Situation/company reports</summary>
                    <p>One important factor affecting capital markets is the current economic conditions of individual companies. The positive economic situation of the company may encourage investors to invest their capital in its shares. The bad economic situation, in turn, forces investors to move their assets to other companies and / or eventually withdraw capital from this country.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Legal acts and taxes</summary>
                    <p>Legal acts, local or international, can have medium to long-term effects on capital markets. Legal acts can create barriers, or vice versa - act as an impetus for foreign economic investment.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Weather</summary>
                    <p>The weather directly affects the prices of goods, which in turn affects the companies that use these goods as raw materials. Rising commodity prices also increase the cost of production. This, in turn, depending on the type of enterprise and company, leads to a decrease in profits and negatively affects the company's financial statements. The deteriorating economic situation leads to a fall in share prices, which in turn forces investors to withdraw capital from this company.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Political situation</summary>
                    <p>Political situations or conditions have a significant impact on capital markets. When a country has a stable political situation (foreign or domestic - international politics), investors comfortably invest in this country. On the other hand, in times of political instability, traders may respond by withdrawing funds from a given market or region.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Economic downturn</summary>
                    <p>An economic downturn can have various sources. It can be financial (for example, a banking crisis), related to goods (for example, an oil crisis), political, or others. It is common that during a recession, people tend to withdraw capital from the market in order to "escape from the worst moment." Therefore, the banking and financial sectors, tourism, automotive, etc. are most at risk.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>The economic growth</summary>
                    <p>The situation of economic growth in a country or region is favorable for companies that sell their products to consumers in this area. Economic growth generally means that customers are more optimistic and in a better economic position, so they can afford more and are more likely to make real purchases. The expected increase in profits of companies selling more and more of their products may attract both local and foreign investors who create demand, resulting in an increase in the price of the company's shares.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Confidence</summary>
                    <p>The confidence indicator reflects the overall picture of how the inhabitants of the country perceive the prospects for the future. It is also one of the factors taken into consideration by central banks when formulating their monetary policy. In general, high customer confidence means that they are more optimistic and willing to spend more on consumption, and as a result, companies will be able to sell more products and earn higher profits. Hence, the attractive prospects of the companies may attract investors, believing that the value of the shares will rise in the future.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Developments</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>One-time events can have a significant impact on capital markets. A good example would be the organization of the Olympic Games in this area, which requires large investments in infrastructure to attract tourists to the region, and which provides a positive incentive for the companies involved. On the other side of the scale, there are negative events such as terrorist attacks. These are of course rare cases, but shortly after the September 11 terrorist attack in the United States, the main stock markets were closed due to the dire consequences for the capital market. Events in one company generally do not affect the overall markets, although there are exceptions. An example of such an exception would be the case of Enron, where more than 20,000 employees were fired due to allegations of financial fraud, after which ENRON went bankrupt.</p>
                        <p>The importance did not lie in the number of laid-off employees, but in the scale of the enterprise, which was one of the main energy companies.</p>
                        <p>Investors should keep a close eye on developments, for the reason that the effects on the capital markets are not always predictable.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Expert forecasts</summary>
                    <p>Experts' forecasts may meet or contradict investors' expectations. As a rule, they do not have a direct influence on the capital markets, however, the mood of market participants can be affected when "experts" represent national authorities - either political or monetary authorities. When monetary authorities make statements about the economy as a whole, they can signal future speeches or hints about the future of monetary policy. This, in turn, can affect the supply of money and the interest rate (the latter being the most interesting factor for foreign investors). Please seek advice from an independent financial adviser if you have any doubts about the specification of market instruments and mechanisms.</p>
